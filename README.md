# Employee_Attrition_using_SVM
 
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify patterns in employee characteristics that lead to attrition and build a model to predict which employees are at risk of leaving the organization.

## Dataset
The dataset contains demographic details, work-related metrics, and an attrition flag. It includes features such as age, department, job role, monthly income, and more. The dataset is sourced from [source name] and contains [number] rows and [number] columns.
